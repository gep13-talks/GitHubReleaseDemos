## What is Semantic Versioning?

+++

### A definition...

"...simple set of rules and requirements that dictate how version numbers are assigned and incremented. These rules are based on, but not necessarily limited to, pre-existing widespread common practices in use in both closed and open-source software."

+++

### The rules

Given a version number MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, increment the:

* MAJOR version when you make incompatible API changes
* MINOR version when you add functionality in a backwards-compatible manner
* PATCH version when you make backwards-compatible bug fixes

Additional labels for pre-release and build metadata are available as extensions to the MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH format.

+++

### Examples

- 0.1.0
- 1.0.0 |
- 0.3.13 |
- 0.2.0-unstable3  |
- 0.2.0-unstable.3+Branch.develop.Sha.e6eb071cd30974b80d7e237b85e7729a1d791e1e |
